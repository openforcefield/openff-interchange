A project (and object) for storing, manipulating, and converting molecular mechanics data.

## Installation

Recent versions of the OpenFF Toolkit (0.11.0+) install Interchange by default through its `conda` package.

Interchange can also be installed manually via `conda`:

```shell
conda install openff-interchange -c conda-forge
```

## Getting started

The `Iterchange` object serves primarily as a container object for parametrized data. It can currently take in [SMIRNOFF](https://openforcefield.github.io/standards/standards/smirnoff/) or [Foyer](https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/) force fields
and [chemical topologies](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/topology.html) prepared via the [OpenFF Toolkit](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/). The resulting object stores parametrized data and provides APIs for export to common formats.

```python3
from openff.toolkit import ForceField, Molecule
from openff.units import unit

from openff.interchange import Interchange


# Use the OpenFF Toolkit to generate a molecule object from a SMILES pattern
molecule = Molecule.from_smiles("CCO")

# Generate a conformer to be used as atomic coordinates
molecule.generate_conformers(n_conformers=1)

# Convert this molecule to a topology
topology = molecule.to_topology()

# Define periodicity via box vectors
topology.box_vectors = unit.Quantity([4, 4, 4], unit.nanometer)

# Load OpenFF 2.0.0 "Sage"
sage = ForceField("openff-2.0.0.offxml")

# Create an Interchange object
out = Interchange.from_smirnoff(force_field=sage, topology=topology)

# Convert the Interchnage object to an OpenMM System
system = out.to_openmm()

# or write to GROMACS files
out.to_gro("out.gro")
out.to_top("out.top")

# or store as JSON
json_blob = out.json()
```
