# Release History

Releases follow versioning as described in
[PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#final-releases), where

* `major` increments denote a change that may break API compatibility with previous `major` releases
* `minor` increments add features but do not break API compatibility
* `micro` increments represent bugfix releases or improvements in documentation

Please note that all releases prior to a version 1.0.0 are considered pre-releases and many API changes will come before a stable release.

## 0.2.0 - 2022-08-29

The 0.2.x line of Interchange targets biopolymer support alongside version 0.11.0 of the OpenFF Toolkit.
Due to the scope of changes, versions 0.2.0 and newer will not generally be compatible with the 0.1.x line or versions of the OpenFF Toolkit less than 0.11.0.
In lieu of a changelog entry for this release, **below is a brief summary of the current capabilities of Interchange.**
Future releases will continue with conventional changelog entries.

Imports from OpenFF Toolkit objects:
  * `Interchange.from_smirnoff`, consuming SMIRNOFF force fields and OpenFF `Topology` objects, including
    * WBO-based bond order interpolation of valence parameters
    * Virtual sites
  * See the [Molecule Cookbook](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/users/molecule_cookbook.html) for information on preparing molecule inputs and [`Molecule`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) API docs for more information.

Imports from MoSDeF objects:
  * `Interchange.from_foyer`
Exports to OpenMM objects:
  * `Interchange.to_openmm` for `openmm.System` objects
  * `Interchange.to_openmm_topology` for `openmm.app.Topology` objects

Exports to GROMACS files:
  * `Interchange.to_top` for `.top` topology files
  * `Interchange.to_gro` for `.gro` coordinate files

Exports to AMBER files (EXPERIMENTAL):
  * `Interchange.to_prmtop` for `.prmtop` parameter/topology files
  * `Interchange.to_inpcrd` for `.inpcrd` coordinate files

Exports to LAMMPS files (EXPERIMENTAL):
  * `Interchange.to_lammps` for `.data` data files

Exports to JAX arrays:
  * Call `.get_force_field_parameters` or `.get_system_parameters` on a `PotentialHandler` subclass to get a [JAX array](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.array.html) of force field or "system" parameters associated with that handler.

Known issues and limitations:
  * Residue hierarchy information may not be preserved in GROMACS and AMBER exports
  * Some operations are slow and not yet optimized for performance, including
    * `Interchange.from_smirnoff`, particularly for large systems with many valence terms
    * `Interchange.to_top`, particularly for systems with polymers, including proteins

During development of this release, the default branch has been renamed from `master` to `main`.
