# Release History

Releases follow versioning as described in
[PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#final-releases), where

* `major` increments denote a change that may break API compatibility with previous `major` releases
* `minor` increments add features but do not break API compatibility
* `micro` increments represent bugfix releases or improvements in documentation

Please note that all releases prior to a version 1.0.0 are considered pre-releases and many API changes will come before a stable release.

In lieu of a changelog entry for this release, **below is a brief summary of the current capabilities of Interchange.**
Future releases will continue with conventional changelog entries.

Imports from OpenFF Toolkit objects:

* `Interchange.from_smirnoff`, consuming SMIRNOFF force fields and OpenFF `Topology` objects, including
  * WBO-based bond order interpolation of valence parameters
  * Virtual sites
* See the [Molecule Cookbook](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/users/molecule_cookbook.html) for information on preparing molecule inputs and [`Molecule`](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit/en/stable/api/generated/openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.html#openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) API docs for more information.

Imports from MoSDeF objects:

* `Interchange.from_foyer`
Exports to OpenMM objects:

* `Interchange.to_openmm` for `openmm.System` objects
* `Interchange.to_openmm_topology` for `openmm.app.Topology` objects

Exports to GROMACS files:

* `Interchange.to_top` for `.top` topology files
* `Interchange.to_gro` for `.gro` coordinate files

Exports to AMBER files (EXPERIMENTAL):

* `Interchange.to_prmtop` for `.prmtop` parameter/topology files
* `Interchange.to_inpcrd` for `.inpcrd` coordinate files

Exports to LAMMPS files (EXPERIMENTAL):

* `Interchange.to_lammps` for `.data` data files

Exports to JAX arrays:

* Call `.get_force_field_parameters` or `.get_system_parameters` on a `PotentialHandler` subclass to get a [JAX array](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.numpy.array.html) of force field or "system" parameters associated with that handler.

Known issues and limitations:

* Residue hierarchy information may not be preserved in GROMACS and AMBER exports
* Some operations are slow and not yet optimized for performance, including
  * `Interchange.from_smirnoff`, particularly for large systems with many valence terms
  * `Interchange.to_top`, particularly for systems with polymers, including proteins

During development of this release, the default branch has been renamed from `master` to `main`.
