# Upcoming changes in Interchange 0.4

The 0.4.x line of releases will be limited to the following upstream versions:

* Python >=3.10
* Pydantic v2
* Openff Toolkit >=0.15

The following attributes have been renamed and deprecated since version 0.3.0 and will be removed:

* `Interchange.handlers` was renamed to `Interchange.collections`
* `Collection.slot_map` was renamed to `Collection.key_map`
  * Note that this applies to all collections, i.e. `SMIRNOFFProperTorsionCollection` is a subclass of `Collection`

The `+` operator on `Interchange` objects, which has only been supported on an experimental basis, is removed and its functionality moved to `Interchange.combine`.
