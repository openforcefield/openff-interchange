    "OpenFF Interchange is a Python package developed by the Open Force Field Initiative for storing, manipulating, and converting molecular mechanics data. The package is oriented around the `Interchange` class, which stores a molecular mechanics system and provides methods to write the system out in numerous formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Interchange` contains a fully parameterized molecular system with all the information needed to start a simulation. This includes the force field, box vectors, positions, velocities, and a topology containing individual molecules and their connectivity. For most users, `Interchange` forms the bridge between the OpenFF ecosystem and their simulation software of choice; users describe their system with the OpenFF Toolkit and then parameterize it with Interchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `Interchange` is created, it can be exported as simulation-ready input files to a number of molecular mechanics software packages, including Amber, OpenMM, GROMACS, and LAMMPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a summary of how data flows through a workflow utilizing OpenFF tools, including where Interchange sits in the flow."
