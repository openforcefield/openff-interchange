### Examples

**Please note that this software in an early and experimental state and unsuitable for production.**
**These notebooks are not currently guaranteed to stable or be updated with experimental API changes.**

Jupyter notebooks demonstrating use cases.

  * `conformer_energies.ipynb`: Given a SMILES string, generate conformers and compute the single-point energy via GROMACS and OpenMM and compare to a result generated by the OpenFF toolkit.
  * `ligand_in_water/ligand_in_water.ipynb`: Solvate a ligand in water and prepare a simulation.
  * `packed_box/packed_box.ipynb`: Prepare a box of organic species for a simulation and compare the
    results of OpenMM, GROMACS, Amber, and LAMMPS.
  * `protein_ligand/protein_ligand.ipynb`: Prepare a protein-ligand system for simulation using
    OpenFF tools and compare the results of OpenMM, GROMACS, Amber, and LAMMPS.
  * `openmm/openmm.ipynb`: Prepare a box of organic species for a simulation with OpenMM.
  * `lammps/lammps.ipynb`: Prepare a box of organic species for a simulation with LAMMPS.

These can all be run in a web browser with [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openforcefield/openff-interchange/main?filepath=%2Fexamples%2F) without inatlling anything on your computer.

#### Deprecated examples
  * `optimize-with-jax.ipynb`: Run a minimal parameter optimization using JAX.
  * `parameter_replacement.ipynb`: Partially replace parameters in a parametrized system with values from a second force field.
  * `parameter_splitting.ipynb`: Split one SMIRKS pattern into two after parametrization.
