    "We can safely use Sage or a similar small molecule force field to parameterize the guest. But the host is large (128 heavy atoms, 184 atoms total) and charge assignment using AM1-BCC may take tens of minutes to hours. We can instead use [OpenFF NAGL](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-nagl), which uses a graph-convolutional neural network (GCNN or GNN) to mimic AM1-BCC partial charges (specifically the ELF10 variant). Not counting the time it takes to import the Python module and load the model, charge assignment for the host should take on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. (Larger polymers may take slightly longer but the scaling is sub-linear with number of atoms!)\n",
