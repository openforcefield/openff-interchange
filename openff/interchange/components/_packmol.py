    Add water and ions to neutralise and solvate a topology.

    Parameters
    ----------
    topology
        The OpenFF Topology to solvate.
    nacl_conc
        The bulk concentration of NaCl in the solvent, in units compatible with
        molarity. This is used to calculate a mass fraction for the bulk
        solvent and does not represent the actual concentration in the final
        box.
    padding : Scalar with dimensions of length
        The desired distance between the solute and the edge of the box. Ignored
        if the topology already has box vectors. The usual recommendation is
        that this equals or exceeds the VdW cut-off distance, so that the
        solute is isolated by its periodic images by twice the cut-off.
    box_shape : Array with shape (3, 3)
        An array defining the box vectors of a box with the desired shape and
        unit periodic image distance. This shape will be scaled to satisfy the
        padding given above. Some typical shapes are provided in this module.
    target_density : Scalar with dimensions of mass density
        The target mass density for the packed box.
    tolerance: Scalar with dimensions of distance
        The minimum spacing between molecules during packing in units of
        distance. The default is large so that added waters do not disrupt the
        structure of proteins; when constructing a mixture of small molecules,
        values as small as 0.5 Å will converge faster and can still produce
        stable simulations after energy minimisation.
